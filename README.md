# Tech-Conferences
Resources for a warm up talk to Brighton Data Forum, hopefully Nov 22: Presentation, Spreadsheet, Speaker's Notes and Jupyter Notebook
<br>
* The talk starts with me simply describing the few conferences I've attended (2019-22) and encouraging more people to attend one <br>
* I show a spreadsheet with missing ratings for a conference that was cancelled because of covid <br>
* I then joke that, "I'll never know what I missed in Paris...but let's use our secret superpowers and find out!" <br>
* I use the example to explain linear regression to non specialists, while keeping the specialists entertained with humorous delivery <br>
* After questions, I turn the tables and ask the specialists in the audience to explain (in the pub afterwards) how the model works at all with so few records
